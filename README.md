## üìå Description
**DiscordBot** is a bot for Discord written in **Java** using **JDA** (Java Discord API). It is designed for psychological support servers, providing ticket management, an economy system, private voice channels, and user rating functionality.

## üîß Features
- üé´ **Ticket System**: Users can create tickets for psychological support. Only users with the "Psychologist" role can claim tickets. A special menu allows psychologists to close or transfer tickets to a "Closed Tickets" category. When a ticket is closed, all messages from it are sent to the log channel.
- üí∞ **Economy System**: Users can check their balance using `/stats`. A `/shop` command allows purchasing roles, and administrators can add roles for sale using `/add_role_to_shop [role_id] [price]`.
- üîä **Private Voice Channels**: Users can create private voice channels with controls to:
  - Lock the channel from other users
  - Rename the voice channel
  - Set a user limit
  - Remove users from the voice channel
- ‚≠ê **Feedback & Rating System**: Users can leave reviews and rate psychologists based on their experience.
